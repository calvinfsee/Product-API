## Description
My project was to overhaul the back-end for a fashion e-commerce page. Node.JS and Express.JS were used to create an API for accessing a PostgreSQL database. I converted the previously monolithic architecture into microservices by connecting multiple AWS EC2 instances with an NGINX load balancer. Testing was done with K6, Loader.IO, and NewRelic.
